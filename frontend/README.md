# Momo Chat — Frontend

This is a minimal React + Vite frontend for the Momo Chat app. It connects to a Socket.IO backend.

Quick start

1. cd into the `frontend` folder
2. npm install
3. npm run dev

By default the client will try to connect to `http://localhost:3000`. You can override this by creating a `.env` file with `VITE_SOCKET_URL`.
